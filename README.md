## What benefits does your proposed work have for GNOME and its community?

The goal of this project is to create a new system panel that will provide users with a unified
interface for managing various settings by moving <b>Date & Time, Users, Region & Language,</b>
and <b>About</b> panels, and Implementing a <b>Remote Desktop</b> page into the new system panel.

By creating a new system panel, we can provide a more streamlined and user-friendly
experience for GNOME users. This will also make it easier for users to find the panel they’re
looking for.

## Description

<b>GNOME Settings</b> (aka gnome-control-center) is a graphical user interface tool used in
GNOME-based Linux distribution for managing system settings and preferences. This proposal
plans to create a new system panel and move Region & Language, Date & Time, Users, and
About panels into a new System panel.

## What city and country will you reside in during the summer?

I will stay at my college in Pala, Kerala, India

## What applications/libraries of GNOME will the proposed work modify or create?

GNOME Settings (aka gnome-control-center)

## What benefits does your proposed work have for GNOME and its community?

The goal of this project is to create a new system panel that will provide users with a unified
interface for managing various settings by moving <b>Date & Time, Users, Region & Language,</b>
and <b>About</b> panels, and Implementing a <b>Remote Desktop</b> page into the new system panel.

By creating a new system panel, we can provide a more streamlined and user-friendly
experience for GNOME users. This will also make it easier for users to find the panel they’re
looking for.

## Why are you the right person to work on this project?

I believe I am the right person to work on this project as I have prior experience working on
open-source projects and I have been using GNOME for a long time. <b>During my contribution, I
learned GTK, GObject, LibAdwaita, XML, UI, C, Git, etc.</b>

Also, <b>I am aware of GNOME’s Newcomer’s guidelines, coding standards, and community
working culture.</b> If I don’t know something, I try my best to learn it and don’t hesitate to ask
questions.

My previous contributions to GNOME and other open-source projects demonstrate my
commitment to the open-source community. I am familiar with the development process, version
control system, and project management tools. I also understand the importance of
documentation, and I always ensure that my code is well-documented.
Overall, I believe that my skills, experience, passion, and commitment make me the right person
to work on this project.

## How do you plan to achieve the completion of your project?

We have approx 12 weeks or even more to achieve the goal and have 5 panels to merge or
implement it into the system panel. The plan is to first study the <b>Accessibility panel</b> for
inspiration to make a minimalistic system panel.

I’ll give approx 2 weeks for attaching each panel as a page to the system panel. <b>Within these 2
weeks, I’ll work on eliminating any errors, and wrong coding standards and updating the
UI with the help of my mentors and extensive use of documentation.</b> After successfully attaching of page,
I will delete that panel from the panel list.

Also, take feedback from my mentors and design team members for any modification apart from
mockups.

## Please provide a sequence of tasks and subtasks and how long (days) you estimate it will take you to complete each of them. Highlight important milestones/deliverables.

My proposed timeline for the tasks will be as follows:

<b>Before May 04</b>
- I’ll continue working on the existing issues and my opened MR which is halted due to GNOME’s UI freeze schedule to get more understanding of the project.
- Also, I’ll keep interacting with the GNOME community to help each other if needed.
- Study the <b>GObject</b> concept.

<b>May 04 – May 28 (Community Bonding Period)</b>
- With the help of my mentors, I’ll familiarize myself with the community and will try to know the culture and ethics of the organization.
